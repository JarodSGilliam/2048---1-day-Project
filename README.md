<h1 align="center">2048 - 1 Day Project</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2><p>
I replicated the game 2048 with Python and Tkinter.
WARNING: Whenever you move, the tiles are unloaded and then reloaded causing a white flash.
<br><br>

</p><h2>Retrospective:</h2><p>
About a day's worth of work went into this project. While it is not now perfect, I am practicing restraint and stopping this micro-project here. I have used the time I allotted myself away from schoolwork and it works so I am going to stop myself before I spend several more hours polishing it.
<br><br>

</p><i>Pros:</i><p>
It fully replicates the game of 2048 and is fully playable.<br>

</p><i>Cons:</i><p>
The flashing every time you move thing.<br>
The code for the movement is not overly pretty. (Runs fast enough to not be noticeable or laggy, I'm just annoyed there was no better solution.)<br>

</p><i>How to Improve:</i><p>
The flashing is just an artifact of this being the first time working with Tkinter. Given more time and/or familiarity with the software, I'm sure this issue has a simple fix.<br>
Looking online at other people's implementations of the 2048 game, it appears that the code is always pretty messy. One would not guess it from the simple appearance of the game but making the blocks combine in that exact way is not as simple as it seems. Potential improvements in this area could be using entities of some kind instead of a double array to keep track of the game board could allow for smoother animations at the cost of increased complexity.<br>
